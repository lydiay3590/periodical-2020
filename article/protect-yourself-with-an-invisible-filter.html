          <p class="author">By Gabriela Bochen</p>
          <article>
            <p>Almost all life on earth depends upon cleanliness of air to function and survive. However, when the air we breathe in becomes polluted, we become polluted. The real cost of air pollution cannot be measured until the health costs are factored in. From substantial exposure to air pollution, humans can experience various negative effects on their health in the short and long term. High air pollution can cause more immediate health implications such as aggreativated cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. These illnesses add stress to the heart and lungs, which requires your body to work harder to supply oxygen to your body. Long term exposure to polluted air has permanent health effects including, accelerated aging in the lungs, loss of lung capacity, and development of diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, and possibly cancer. With laws in place to decrease air pollution, there are still significant amounts of air pollution in the atmosphere. So, how do you protect yourself from air pollution?</p>

            <p>A new and innovative way to protect yourself from the harmful effects of air pollution is through the use of a transport nose filter. These filters are fairly affordable, with prices ranging from 10.95 for a pack of then and 18.95 for a pack of 20. The O2 nose filters could help tackle the effects of the pollution crisis that plagues modern cities. On the company's website, the creator claims ‘O2 nose filters create a safer, cleaner personal air zone with protection from airborne pollution, allergens, bacteria and more.’ Each filter can be worn for up to 12 hours and uses electrostatic filters to capture particulate matter, any small miscrospic pollutant that floats in the air.  Particulates are often divided into two basic groups based on their size: PM10 and PM2.5. PM10 and larger are coarse particles including pollen, mold spores, sawdust, and dust. PM2.5 and smaller are fine particles including smoke, viruses and bacteria, and exhausts.</p>

            <p>The filtration efficiency of the O2 Nose Filters varies based on the size and speed of the particles. According to the O2 filter website, tests have demonstrated that smaller particles are effectively filtered out 90% of the time and larger particles are blocked out 65% of the time. This filter distinctly filtrates harmful particulate matter from entering your body. However, you breathe through your mouth too, in this case, the filter cannot protect you from that. As a result, the nasal filter is a viable and effective choice when looking to breathe in cleaner air, but it's not complete protection. It's up to society to make adjustments in their lifestyles to support the change for healthier and cleaner air.</p>
