          <h1 id="article-title">Air Tanks</h1>
          <p class="author">By Ikram Ramdani</p>
          <article>
            <p>Ever wonder how a small air tank contains air that lasts for hours? We know that air takes up a lot of space and volume; therefore forcing it into a rigid aluminum container seems like a bad idea due to the increase in pressure, but that’s why there’s a tube attached to the tank rather than inhaling straight out of the tank. If you were to breathe directly out of the tank it would damage your lungs because of the pressure the tank is in. There are many uses of air tanks, it’s used for medical purposes, astronauts use it in space and for recreational purposes.  Air tanks come in many sizes depending on the amount of pressure you’ll be undertaking.</p>

            <p class="text-center"><img src="../img/article-img/air-tanks/aeration-system.gif" class="body-image"></p>

            <p>Air tanks essentially are equilibrium reactions, which convert the liquefied oxygen mix into gas; it has a ratio of liquid and gas depending on the amount of pressure it must undergo. Different types of mixtures are found in different air tanks to accommodate the organism in the specific environment the organism will undertake. A big misconception many have is that the air tanks are all filled with just pure oxygen, certain tanks do have only pure oxygen in them but they can be lethal and dangerous. On Earth breathing in pure oxygen would damage your brain and lungs but in space astronauts must inhale pure oxygen for a few hours in order to get rid of the nitrogen in the astronaut's body. Astronauts need to get rid of the nitrogen, if not they will be covered in gas bubbles when they walk in space. Pure oxygen could be used for recreational purposes if the diver has carefully calculated the decompression dives because pure oxygen is highly flammable and reactive. This redox reaction will cause a combustion. Pure oxygen can be beneficial or fatal based on the pressure of the environment the organism is in. </p>

            <p>Many things can go wrong when using air tanks. Injuries can occur as pressure changes or when air tanks are not regulated after diving which can be fatal or dangerous. Examples of injuries are that the tissues near the air-filled spaces of your body—such as your ears (which can cause a ruptured eardrum), sinuses, dental roots, and lungs can be damaged which is known as Barotrauma. Decompression sickness, you can get paralyzed as the nerves and tissues get damaged or even die due to the bubbles formed in the brain. And if you dive too deep, the nitrogen messes with the chemical compounds in the brain which will have you feeling confused and drunk which can cause you to make life threatening decisions this injury is called Nitrogen narcosis. Air tanks used in the hospital such as ventilators can cause the lungs to stretch which can also lead to barotrauma or damage the lung cells. And if the patient receives too much pressure the lungs will explode. To summarize the effect of the pressure on air tanks must be regulated to ensure safety for the organism using the air tanks.</p>
