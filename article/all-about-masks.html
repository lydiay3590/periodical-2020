          <h1 id="article-title">All About Masks</h1>
          <p class="author">By Melih Yumusak</p>
          <article>
            <p>There are many reasons as to why masks have different numbers and letters. Professions involving medicine and manual labor require the use of a variety of masks. These masks can range from simple surgical masks to P100 charcoal filters that are powerful enough to filter out microscopic organic compounds. (ex. tear gas)</p>

            <p>However P-100 and N-95 masks are known as air-purifying respirators due to their need to extract air from the outside. Although these masks are great at filtering air, they are still difficult to use and have a tendency to form a bad seal over one's face or the mouth leading to its drop in effectiveness. Another type of mask is a supplied air respirator paired with a tank containing clean air; however, the tank only contains a limited amount of air.</p>

            <p>Air-purifying respirators are rated by assigning letters and numbers. The surgical mask, which has little to no protection from airborne particles, is in the lowest tier of masks that will not be rated using letters or numbers. The lettering in front of all masks determines whether it will protect against oil or not, a ‘’n” stands for no protection against oil, the  “p” stands for oil proof, and an “r“ means the mask is resistant to oil. After the lettering there is a number which determines whether how much of a particle that is .3 microns or over is able to pass through. This is an extremely small size being much smaller than a human hair. After all of this  there is a another ranking which is only meant for chemical masks that have the ability to cling to chemicals using a layer of charcoal. A mask with the number 100 has the ability to purify 99.97% percent of airborne particles, a 99 can purify 99% and finally a 95 will purify 95%.</p>

            <p> This numbering is all based on the material that the mask is made of; therefore, it is safe to assume there would be one meant for larger applications like filtering air at a hospital,and this is true these filters are usually referred to as hepa filters. A private research that was conducted discovered that hepa filters had the same filtering capabilities as a N95 mask and many people capitalized on this by making their own filters using this material.</p>
