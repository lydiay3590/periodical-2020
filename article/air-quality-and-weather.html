          <h1 id="article-title">Air Quality and Weather</h1>
          <p class="author">By Amir Samarxhiu</p>
          <article>
            <p>The air we breathe helps us live every second of our lives. Air can be affected by the weather since the weather consists of many factors including snow, rain, hail, temperature, etc. Our bodies use oxygen obtained from air to help break down sugars to help our cells function within our bodies. Waste is produced after these functions and results in carbon dioxide. It’s the reason why we breathe oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.</p>

            <p>Temperature plays a huge role in the weather. Temperature is a major factor in breathing in the air: dry, hot, cold, etc. People can have issues when it comes to breathing in cold air and dry air. Breathing in cold and dry air can irritate a person’s airways. Irritation within the airways decreases the amount of oxygen a person can breathe, resulting in shortness of breath, coughing, etc. Research by Editorial Staff on the American Lung Association has shown to create “airway inflammation and exacerbate respiratory disorders” (Editorial Staff 1). Therefore, the temperature of the air is important because it’s vital in keeping our airway away from irritation.</p>

            <!--<img>-->
            <p>Our bodies do their best to maintain body temperature at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Any temperature that’s above or below 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit can cause our bodies to use more oxygen and more energy to maintain that constant body temperature. This may result in decreased blood oxygen levels and increased sensations of shortness of breath since the body is consuming a lot of oxygen (Weather and Breathing). These issues can be problematic for the human body because shortness of breath can lead to tiredness, exhaustion, etc. This can also relate to the amount of clothing we wear during the different seasons. For example, during the winter, we all wear multiple layers of clothing in order to prevent heat loss within our bodies. With less heat loss, our bodies wouldn’t have to work as hard to maintain the body temperature and our bodies would have to use less oxygen and less energy compared to wearing less layers of clothing in the winter.</p>

            <p>Humidity is the amount of water vapor that is present within the air. Too much percentage involving humidity poses conflicts with breathing. With high amounts of humidity and water vapor, people breathe in less oxygen because of the density of the water vapor. With the water vapor being so dense, it can create more air resistance, a force caused by friction to oppose the natural way we breathe in oxygen, within a person’s airway. With an increase in air resistance, less oxygen will flow into our lungs, and the human body will be supplied with less energy.</p>

            <!--<img>-->

            <p>Shortness of breath can be affected by weather patterns. For example, thunderstorms have a possibility of affecting a person’s breathing due to pollen grains. During thunderstorms, the winds created by the thunderstorms can pick up some of the pollen grains at the ground level and, depending on the person’s condition, the person could experience shortness of breath, fast breathing, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness (3 Health Conditions That Stormy Weather Can Make Worse 1). This results in less intake of oxygen and less carbon dioxide being exhaled. If humans aren’t able to breathe out carbon dioxide, we would have more waste within our bodies and less space for other substances within our bloodstream since we breathe out carbon dioxide through our blood vessels.</p>


              <p>Overall, the weather can have a significant effect on our breathing. It can range from consuming lots of oxygen to exhaling less carbon dioxide. Despite there being many negative effects to our breathing process, people can always be prepared to combat these issues. For example, try to stay in places where the air isn’t too dry or too moist. It’s always important to know the weather outside and around your area to help prepare yourself for your surroundings.</p>
